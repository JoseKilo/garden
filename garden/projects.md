# Projects

When choosing a project, remember to consider:

1. Personal interests and passions
2. Available resources (tools/materials/skills)
3. Timeframe for completion VS size of the project
4. Potential impact or relevance
5. Constraints imposed by external factors

## Choosing a project when limited in time

If I only have a few hours to spare, remember to:

1. Prioritize urgent tasks
2. Work on projects with momentum
3. Choose small, achievable goals
4. Rotate through different projects
5. Track tasks, ideas and random thoughts in some way

## How to create momentum for a project

1. Set clear and measurable goals
2. Break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps
3. Celebrate wins along the way
4. Establish routines and habits
5. Get buy-in from others
6. Use visual reminders
7. Track your progress
8. Tackle urgent tasks
9. Create a timeline for completing the project (milestones, deadlines, etc).
10. Identify quick wins that can be achieved quickly and easily

If everything else fails start with some small but useful meta task, for
example:

1. Upgrade dependencies
2. Document
3. Write missing tests
4. Configure your editor

## On-going tasks

1. Identify challenges and roadblocks.
2. Prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.
3. Look for opportunities for using existing knowledge and experience.
