# Projects

When choosing a project, remember to consider:

1. Personal interests and passions
2. Available resources (tools/materials/skills)
3. Timeframe for completion
4. Potential impact or relevance
5. Constraints imposed by external factors

If I only have a few hours to spare, remember to:

1. Prioritize urgent tasks
2. Work on projects with momentum
3. Choose small, achievable goals
4. Rotate through different projects
5. Track tasks, ideas and random thoughts in some way
