However, it can be used to generate static sites in general. I was inspired to follow this strategy after seeing Tiger's Digital Garden , which uses the same tool. Why did I like this idea ? MkDocs works by rendering Markdown files to generate each of the site's pages. I'm very used to writing documentation using Markdown after years working on tech projects. I like working with Markdown because it's very simple and allows me to focus on the content rather than the format of the text. Usually blog-like pages rely on complex user-interfaces to tweak almost every detail of the site. I only need Vim (my preferred text editor) to add new notes to this site. MkDocs also comes with built-in support to upload the generated site directly to GitHub Pages, which I'm using for hosting. That's one technical complexity less to distract me from the actual content. Since MkDocs original intent is sharing technical documentation, the site gets some navigational features for free, like the list of notes, the table of contents, the text search, etc. Which I think are very useful for exploring this kind of mental notes, while being simple enough to not get in the way. Since the source files are basically text files, I can use git to keep a history of the changes, in case I need to come back and review some previous version or revert any changes. The same source files can be made available in a public repository in GitHub , which allows the history and tools configuration to be shared. I think this aligns with the goal of working with the garage door up .","title":"MkDocs"},{"location":"mkdocs/#mkdocs","text":"These pages are rendered using MkDocs , a tool originally intended to publish documentation for technical projects.
